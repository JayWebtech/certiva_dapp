# UniChain: Decentralized Academic Credential Verification 🎓🔗

UniChain is a **decentralized, blockchain-based platform** built on **Starknet** that revolutionizes the way academic credentials are issued, stored, and verified. By leveraging **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and **tamper-proof blockchain technology**, UniChain eliminates academic fraud, ensures privacy, and provides instant verification for employers and institutions.

## 🌟 Why UniChain?  
Academic credential fraud is a growing problem, and traditional verification methods are slow, costly, and prone to errors. UniChain solves this by:  
- **Eliminating fraud** with blockchain-backed, tamper-proof degrees.  
- **Protecting privacy** using hashed identifiers and ZKPs.  
- **Enabling instant verification** for employers and institutions.  
- **Seamlessly integrating** with HR platforms, job portals, and university systems via APIs.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

### 1. Degree Issuance by Universities  
   - Universities issue degrees through UniChain’s platform.  
   - Each degree is **digitally signed** and stored on the blockchain.  
   - Universities prove domain ownership using **DNS verification** to ensure authenticity.  

### 2. Secure Storage  
   - Degree metadata is stored on **Starknet** for immutability.  

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Verification  
   - Employers and institutions can verify degrees in **real-time** without accessing sensitive student data.  
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** ensure privacy by allowing verification without exposing personal information.  

### 4. Student Consent for Verification  
   - Before certificates are published on-chain, the student must provide their **public wallet address**.  
   - When an employer initiates verification, the student must **sign a message** off-chain to approve the verification request.  
   - This ensures that even if someone has access to the student’s ID, they cannot verify the certificate without the student’s explicit permission.

### **Key Points**

1. **Public Wallet Address:**  
   - The student provides their public wallet address during certificate issuance.  
   - This address is used to verify the student’s identity during the verification process.  

2. **Off-Chain Signing:**  
   - The student signs a structured message (e.g., containing the certificate hash and employer’s address) using their wallet.  
   - This signature proves that the student has authorized the verification request.  

3. **On-Chain Verification:**  
   - The employer submits the signed message to the blockchain.  
   - A smart contract verifies the student’s signature and the certificate’s validity.  

4. **Explicit Permission:**  
   - Without the student’s signature, the verification request cannot proceed.  
   - This prevents unauthorized parties from verifying the certificate, even if they have access to the student’s ID.

### 5. Seamless Integration  
   - UniChain provides **APIs** for easy integration with HR platforms, job portals, and university systems.
